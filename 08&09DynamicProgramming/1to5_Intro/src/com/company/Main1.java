//Companies with high base package will ask surely on this topic.
//Do not just make the table for DP, solve the question using recursion and then and only then apply memoization or use top-down table.
//So,it is a must to write recursive function for the problem.Hence, DP = recursion + storage;
//Memoization:- In computing, memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of
//expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again
//Dynamic Programming is enhanced recursion .Now it is like recursion, but we save some data in order to optimize time complexity of the recursion.
//So, parent of DP is recursion. Hence, if you know recursion it will be easier to grasp DP.

//It is very similar as we have to check if the choices exists and if there is an overlap then we use DP.
//If in recursion you have a function calling itself only once then DP can never be applied.
//If function is calling itself more than or equal to 2 times then it may be possible to apply DP, consider applying it if overlap exists in recursive tree.
//That is, if in recursive tree if answer is already calculated for a case, we don't do that again leading to better time complexity.
//Mostly optimal things like max,min largest etc. will be asked in DP.
//In the image you can see topics related to DP. Question asked will revolve around this topic with modifications, master these,and you will solve any DP.
//around 85% problems will be solved!
