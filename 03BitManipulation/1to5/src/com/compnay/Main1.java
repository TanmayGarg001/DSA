        //Subtracting 1 from a decimal number flips all the bits after the rightmost set bit(which is 1) including the rightmost set bit.
        //for example :
        //10 in binary is 00001010
        //9 in binary is 00001001
        //8 in binary is 00001000
        //7 in binary is 00000111
        //So if we subtract a number by 1 and do it bitwise & with itself (n & (n-1)), we unset the rightmost set bit. If we do n & (n-1)
        //in a loop and count the number of times the loop executes, we get the set bit count.
